This post is about a single objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. [Particle Swarm Optimization][Particle-Swarm-Optimization] is a nature-inspired heuristic optimization algorithm. 
It allows one to find the global minimum of a function subject to any constraints without calculating any gradients. 

Single objective optimization consists of finding the global miniumum of a function, $ f(x, y) $, over a range of bounds for x and y, and subject to some constraint. 
For example, consider the function:

$$ f(x, y) = sin(y)e^{\((1-cos(x))^{2}} + cos(x)e^{\((1-sin(x))^{2}} + (x - y)^{2} $$

The goal of Single Objective Optimization is to find the global minium of this function, which is $$ f(-3.13, -1.58) = -106.76 $$. However, this function has multiple local minumums, which can make it difficult to solve. 
A resource for psuedo code for this algorithm can be found [here][pseudo-code].

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic search method that finds the global minimum of a function by taking an a number of guesses and moving them around in the search space. 
Each particle is aware of it's own location and the value of it's function value. Then, 




### Example Equation

$$
\begin{align}
  \tag{1.1}
  V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3
\end{align}
$$

### Example code snippets

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
