This post is about a single objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. [Particle Swarm Optimization][Particle-Swarm-Optimization] is a nature-inspired heuristic optimization algorithm. 
It allows one to find the global minimum of a function subject to any constraints without calculating any gradients. 
A resource for psuedo code for this algorithm can be found [here][pseudo-code].

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic search method that finds the global minimum of a function by taking an a number of guesses and moving them around in the search space. 
Each particle is aware of it's own location and the value of it's 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
