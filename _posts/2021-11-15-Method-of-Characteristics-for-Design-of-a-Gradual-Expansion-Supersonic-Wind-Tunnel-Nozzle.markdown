The design of a nozzle contour for a supersonic nozzle is a difficult problem, and this article presents a simplified solution for two dimensional supersonic nozzle design. There are two main types of supersonic nozzles.
First is a minimum length nozzle, designed for rocket engines. These nozzles achieve isentropic expansion for a target exit mach number in the minimum possible length, therefore minimizing mass.
Second is a gradual expansion nozzle, designed for use in supersonic wind tunnels. These nozzles also achieve isentropic expansion for a target exit mach number, but are longer and achieve a more desireable flow in the wind tunnel test section. 

There are many resources for minimum length rocket nozzle design. Below is a list of resources for reference. 
- [Minimum Length Nozzles][Paper-1]  
- [Wind Tunnel Nozzle Design][Paper-2] 
- [Ansys Tutorial for Method of Characteristics][Video-1]
- [Tutorial for solving by hand][Video-2]
- [MATLAB video tutorial][Video-3]

To summarize the method of Characteristics,

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
